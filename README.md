Why did the chicken cross the road? 
The lights were red so there was minimal risk of the chicken being hit by an onciming vehicle. This, of course, assumes that all the road users are following the highway code and stick to the rules of the road very carefully. In the event, however, of a rogue driver, this risk would be much more elevated and the chicken should not be crossing the road. The chicken however, would not recognise this event and would cross anyway. Call it bravery or stupidity, the chicken is determined to be on the other side of the road.
